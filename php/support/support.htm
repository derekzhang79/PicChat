						As used in this policy, the terms “using” and “processing” information include using cookies on a computer or a mobile device, subjecting the information to statistical or other analysis and using or handling information in any way, including, but not limited to collecting, storing, evaluating, modifying, deleting, using, combining, disclosing and transferring information within our organization or among our affiliates within the United States or internationally.<br><br>

						Information Collection and Use<br><br>

						Our primary goals in collecting information are to provide and improve our Services and to enable users to enjoy and easily navigate the Services.<br><br>

						Personal Information. When using our Services, we may ask that you provide us with some personally identifiable information – information about you that can be used to contact or identify you, and information on your use or potential use of the Services and related services (“Personal Information”). Personal Information that we might collect includes information like your name and email address. Personal Information may also include other information you supply to us concerning your preferences and interests expressed in the course of using the Services.

						Application Usage Information. When you use our Services, our servers will automatically record information that your mobile device sends or transmits, including, but not limited to, the device ID number, user settings, location and information about your use of the Services. We only store, track and monitor general usage and not information specific to any user. We use this information to improve the Services, develop new products, and offer products and services that may be of interest to you.<br><br>

						We also use “cookies” on our Services to collect information. We use cookies to save your preferences and personalize the Services for you. Third-­‐party advertisers may also place or read cookies through the Services. You can instruct your device or browser, by changing its options, to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie. If you do not accept cookies, however, you may not be able to use all portions or all functionality of the Services.<br><br>

						Information Sharing and Disclosure<br><br>

						We do not share Personal Information with third parties except as follows:<br><br>


						 Service Providers. We may employ third parties to facilitate the Services, to provide the Services on our behalf, to perform related services or to assist us in analyzing how our Services are used. These third parties have access to your Personal Information only to perform these tasks on our behalf and are not authorized to disclose or use it for any other purpose.
<br><br>

						 Aggregate Information. We may share aggregated information that does not include Personal Information and we may otherwise disclose aggregated application usage information with third parties (including suppliers, advertisers, research companies and other organizations) for industry analysis, demographic
















						profiling and other purposes. Any information shared in these contexts will not contain your Personal Information.<br><br>


						 Compliance with Laws and Law Enforcement. We will cooperate with government and law enforcement officials and private parties to enforce and comply with the law. We will disclose any information about you to government or law enforcement officials or private parties as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate to respond to claims and legal process (including but not limited to subpoenas), to protect our property and rights or a third party, to protect the safety of the public or any person, or to prevent or stop activity we may consider to be, or to pose a risk of being, any illegal, unethical or legally actionable activity.

We will make any legally required disclosures of any breach of the security, confidentiality, or integrity of your unencrypted electronically stored “personal data” (as defined in applicable state statutes on security breach notification) to you via email or conspicuous posting through the Services in the most expedient time possible and without unreasonable delay, insofar as consistent with (i) the legitimate needs of law enforcement or (ii) any measures necessary to determine the scope of the breach and restore the reasonable integrity of the data system.

						International Transfer<br><br>

						Your information may be transferred to — and maintained on — computers located outside of your state, province, country or other governmental jurisdiction where the privacy laws may not be as protective as those in your jurisdiction. If you are located outside the United States and choose to provide information to us, we may transfer Personal Information to the United States and processes it there.
